## Program Description
The program sorts a vector of `Record` structures, which represent the personal records in the database. The program uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header to sort the vector based on the name. The sorted records are then printed to the console.

## Concepts Used
The program uses the following concepts:

- Structs: The program uses a struct `Record` to represent the personal records in the database.
- Vectors: The program uses a vector of `Record` structures to store and manipulate the data.
- Function Pointers: The program uses a function pointer `compare` to specify the comparison function used by the `sort` function.
- Standard Library Functions: The program uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header to sort the vector based on the name.
