## Program Description
The program sorts an integer array and a float array using the selection sort algorithm. The program uses a function template `selectionSort` to sort the arrays. The sorted arrays are then printed to the console.

## Concepts Used
The program uses the following concepts:

- Function Templates: The program uses a function template `selectionSort` to sort an array of type `T`.
- Loops: The program uses nested `for` loops to iterate over the elements of the arrays.
- Conditional Statements: The program uses an `if` statement to check if an element is less than the current minimum element.
- Standard Library Functions: The program uses the `swap` function from the `<algorithm>` header to swap two elements in the array.
