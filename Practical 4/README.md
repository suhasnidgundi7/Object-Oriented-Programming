## Program Description
The program creates an output file named `output.txt`, writes two lines of information to the file, closes the file, opens it again as an input file, and reads the information from the file. The program uses `ofstream` and `ifstream` objects to write and read the information, respectively.

## Concepts Used
The program uses the following concepts:

- File I/O: The program uses `ofstream` and `ifstream` objects to write and read information to and from a file, respectively.
- Conditional Statements: The program uses an `if-else` statement to check if the file can be opened for writing or reading.
- Loops: The program uses a `while` loop to read the information from the file using the `getline` function.
- Exception Handling: The program returns a non-zero value if the file cannot be opened for writing or reading.
