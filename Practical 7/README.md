## Program Description
The program creates a map `state_populations` that associates the names of states with their populations. The program prompts the user to enter the name of a state, and then looks up the population of the state in the map using the `find` function. If the state is found in the map, the program prints the population of the state to the console. Otherwise, the program prints an error message.

## Concepts Used
The program uses the following concepts:

- Maps: The program uses a map to store and manipulate the data.
- Standard Library Functions: The program uses the `find` function from the `<map>` header to look up the population of a state in the map.
